1. Class definition
2. Constructor
    - instance vars
    - params
    - optional params
3. Getters & Setters
4. Public methods and private methods
5. Inheritance
    - children class specific methods
    - overriding parent class methods
    - extending constructor
6. Composition - use other class
7. Getters & Setters shortcuts
    - attr_writer, attr_reader
    - attr_accessor (2in1: attr_writer + attr_reader)

10. Basic two-ways class relationships
    - real life example: Alex `has many` animals: a dog, a spider, a cat. And each of these animals `belongs to` one owner, right? A dog belongs to Alex. A spider belongs to Alex. A cat belongs to Alex
    - `has many` - one object of class X can have a collection of objects of class Y (e.g. alex.animals)
    - `belongs to` - one object of class Y `belongs to` exactly one  object of class X (e.g. animal.owner)
    - making sure that relationship works both ways
11. Three classes relationship (has-many-through relationship)
    - real life example: a dog `has many` vet visits in their life and each of these visits `belongs to` one vet. From anther perspective: a vet `has many visits` and each of these visits `belongs to` one animal. End result is that that a dog `has many` vets through visits and a vet `has many` animals through visits.
    - `has many` + `belongs to` between class X and Y (e.g. dog.visits + visit.animal)
